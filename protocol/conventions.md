### Interim Protocol / Planning 11/04/2025


#### Language

The programming Language is Typescript.
The language used in the code is English.
Therefore, variable names will also be based on English words.

#### Naming

Folders: snake case (lowercase letters and underscores)
File: kebab-case (lowercase letters and hyphens)
Variables: camel-case (start with lowercase letters and add uppercase letters for new words)
Functions: camel-case (start with lowercase letters and add uppercase letters for new words)

#### Comments

Docstrings should be used in the backend to explain functions in a meaningful way, if necessary.

#### Angular

The following components are used:
- Main page (large component) -> "home"
- App -> "app"
- Score board (loaded on the start page) ->"scoreboard"
- Game page ->"game"
- Selection (pop-up)-> "selection-popup"
- Score (pop-up, redirect to further rounds/homepage) ->"score-popup"
- InfoComponent (extra page with info on how to play) -> "info"
- Footer -> link ImprintComponent ->"footer"
- ImprintComponent -> "imprint"
- Logo -> "logo"

-> Header depends on which page you are.

#### Structure

The frontend and backend can be found in the same repository.
However, there is a clear division into the respective folders (frontend, backend).
