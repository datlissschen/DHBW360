### Interim Protocol / Planning 11/04/2025

#### Language

The programming Language is Typescript.
The language used in the code is English.
Therefore, variable names will also be based on English words.

#### Naming

Folders: snake case (lowercase letters and underscores)
File: kebab-case (lowercase letters and hyphens)
Variables: camel-case (start with lowercase letters and add uppercase letters for new words)
Functions: camel-case (start with lowercase letters and add uppercase letters for new words)

#### Comments

Docstrings should be used in the backend to explain functions in a meaningful way, if necessary.

#### Angular

The components used for Angular are, on the one hand, the large component of the start page.
- Start page (large component)
- Score board (loaded on the start page)
- Game page
- Selection (pop-up)
- Score (pop-up, redirect to further rounds/homepage)
- Info (extra page with info on how to play)
- Footer -> Imprint
- Logo

#### Structure

The frontend and backend can be found in the same repository.
However, there is a clear division into the respective folders (frontend, backend).
